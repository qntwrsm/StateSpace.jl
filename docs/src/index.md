# StateSpace.jl

This is a package for state filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation in state space models.

Provides methods for a state space model such as filtering (Kalman filter), smoothing (Kalman smoother), forecasting, likelihood evaluation, and estimation of hyperparameters (Maximum Likelihood, Expectation-Maximization (EM), and Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM), w/ and w/o penalization).

Currently only supports filtering, smoothing, and estimation for linear Gaussian state space models.
